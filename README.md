# A2BAR Antagonists Design

The repository is the achieve of toolbox for the protocal to design the adenosine A2B receptor (A2BAR) antagonists with deep learning tools [reinvent-scaffold-decorator](https://github.com/undeadpixel/reinvent-scaffold-decorator).

A relevant paper [**Deep Learning-based Design and Screening of Benzimidazole-pyrazine derivatives as Adenosine A2B Receptor Antagonists**] (https://doi.org/10.1080/07391102.2023.2295974) is published at *Journal of Biomolecular Structure & Dynamics*.

The datasets and other supplemental data are openly available at Zenodo: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8318722](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8318722)
