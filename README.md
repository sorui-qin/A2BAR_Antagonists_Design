# A2BAR_Antagonists_Design
The repository is the achieve of toolbox for the protocal to design the adenosine A2B receptor (A2BAR) antagonists.  
Relevant paper ***Deep Learning-based Design and Screening of Benzimidazole-pyrazine derivatives as Adenosine A2B Receptor Antagonists*** is submitted and going to be published in the near future.  
The datasets and other supplemental data are openly available at Zenodo: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8318722
